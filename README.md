This is the repository for the published version of the website

Suggested things to work on:

- Replacing menu bar links with fontawesome icons. I didn't spend much time on this but I couldn't get it to work.

- Putting some basic info on the homepage above the feed. Again, I didn't spend much time on this but it wasn't immediately obvious to me how to do it.

- Adding tags to the homepage. I tagged each post as event, bookclub, talk, workshop, etc and it might be nice to make use of these takes somehow for website navigation. I didn't even try this but think it's probably easy.
