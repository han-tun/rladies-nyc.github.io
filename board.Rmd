I work as a Data Analyst at Etsy with our search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. In summer 2016, I completed Metis’s three-month, full-time Data Science Bootcamp, where I did several data science projects, ranging from using random forests to predict successful projects on DonorsChoose.org to building an application in R Shiny that helps data science freelancers find their best-fit jobs. Before Metis, I graduated in June from INSEAD with a Master’s degree in Management (specialization in Organizational Behavior). I also earned my bachelor’s degree from Rice University in Decision Sciences, an interdisciplinary major I designed that focused on understanding how people behave and make decisions.
