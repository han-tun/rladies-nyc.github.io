## Book club

We host a quarterly book club at [Rizzoli](https://www.rizzolibookstore.com/) book store. Check out and join our [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/225365-r-ladies-nyc) group to see the books we've read in the past and to see and make suggestions for future book club books.

*Stay tuned for information about our next book club in January 2018!*
