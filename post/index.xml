&lt;p&gt;7:55-8:00pm R-Ladies Community announcement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8:00-8:30pm Networking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reproducibility-in-an-office-world-a-brief-history-of-failures-and-the-odd-success&#34;&gt;Reproducibility in an Office World: A Brief History of Failures and the Odd Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many data scientists operate at the interface of two cultures with different tools and workflows - programmatic workflows (e.g., R Markdown) and WYSIWYG documents (e.g., Microsoft Word). The noisy interface between these can be an impediment to reproducibility, as well as a royal pain. I will discuss approaches I and others have tried in dealing with these issues, and why and how some have failed and succeeded. I&amp;rsquo;ll also demonstrate some tools, including packages officer and rvg and some rarely used feaures of rmarkdown that ease the flow when collaborating across the divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noam Ross is a Senior Research Scientist at EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit in NYC that researches the connections between human and wildlife health. Noam builds models to understand and predict disease circulation in wildlife and spillover into people. Noam is also editor for software peer review at rOpenSci, a developer collective that builds R packages and catalyzes communities to enable open research and data. He has a Ph.D. in ecology from the University of California-Davis. Follow him on twitter at @noamross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slides from Noam&amp;rsquo;s talk can be found on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/noamross/2018-11-06-rladies-talk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Noam&amp;rsquo;s GitHub account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-data-odyssey-communicating-results-with-coworkers&#34;&gt;A Data Odyssey: Communicating Results With Coworkers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, data scientists are tasked with communicating their results with people in the workplace who do not share the same technical background. Bridging the gaps between parties can be a perilous journey. In this talk, I will discuss how I have attempted to navigate this tricky terrain and provide some pointers for clear language use and data visualization choices. Iâ€™ll demonstrate how I pass on insights through visualizations using packages such as ggridges and ggalluvial and how I use rmarkdown to craft reports and take my coworkers on data adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ludmila Janda is a Data Scientist at Amplify, a pioneer in Kâ€“12 education since 2000, leading the way in next-generation curriculum and assessment. Today, Amplify serves four million students in all 50 states. Ludaâ€™s work provides insights on student and teacher usage, student success, and Amplifyâ€™s broader impact. She is a proud RLady and has a Masterâ€™s in Public Policy from the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. Follow her on twitter at @ludmila_janda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;talk&#34;&gt;Talk:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants their code to run faster and there are numerous ways to achieve this goal. We start by looking at popular packages &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;data.table&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;purrr&lt;/code&gt; and the corresponding parallel implementations. We then turn our attention to writing simple C++ functions integrated into R, both sequentially and in parallel. We also build a &lt;code&gt;data.frame&lt;/code&gt; aggregation function, starting sequentially, ending in parallel. Throughout this talk we see how to speed up code by running in parallel, locally and across nodes, in R and C++, all within the friendly confines of RStudio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-jared&#34;&gt;About Jared:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jared Lander is the Chief Data Scientist of Lander Analytics a data science consultancy based in New York City, the Organizer of the New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup and the New York R Conference and an Adjunct Professor of Statistics at Columbia University. With a masters from Columbia University in statistics and a bachelors from Muhlenberg College in mathematics, he has experience in both academic research and industry. His work for both large and small organizations ranges from music and fund raising to finance and humanitarian relief efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He specializes in data management, multilevel models, machine learning, generalized linear models, data management and statistical computing. He is the author of R for Everyone: Advanced Analytics and Graphics, a book about R Programming geared toward Data Scientists and Non-Statisticians alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;big-data-in-r-with-small-prototypes-scaling-research-workflows-from-local-to-cloud-cluster&#34;&gt;Big Data in R with Small Prototypes: Scaling Research Workflows from [/Local] to [Cloud/Cluster]&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk motivated by a recent project, Emily will discuss the tools her team at AT&amp;amp;T Labs explored when their typical workflow to process a data set and build a machine learning model in R would not scale due to the size of the data. She will provide some considerations for the data scientist faced with such a challenge, as well as a brief introduction to sparklyr. Created by the RStudio team, this package provides a dplyr interface to Spark from R, and thereby enables straightforward access to Sparkâ€™s distributed machine learning algorithms in MLlib.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emily is a Senior Inventive Scientist in the Statistics Research Department at AT&amp;amp;T Labs, where she currently focuses on predictive modeling for advertising applications and the creation of interactive tools for data analysis and visualization. She is a member of R Forwards &lt;a href=&#34;https://forwards.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://forwards.github.io/&lt;/a&gt;, the R Foundation taskforce on women and other under-represented groups. Prior to joining AT&amp;amp;T Labs in 2015, Emily taught high school math for three years at Choate Rosemary Hall. She received her M.A. in statistics from Yale University and B.A. in mathematics from Smith College.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The 2018 New York R Conference was my first ever R conference, and it was great. Iâ€™ll write here about my experience, with links to resources from the widely varying talks.
First and foremost, I want to thank RLadiesNYC for the scholarship which allowed me to attend the conference. As a self-taught R newbie and incoming grad student, I greatly benefitted from attending this conference, and I so appreciate the opportunity from this great group!</description>

      <description>As it grew nearer to the fall season my heart and mind grew heavier. This was the first birthday and holiday gatherings without grandma. I became distant from everything outside of my family and work, and knew I had to get out of this emotional funk. The 2017 Women in Statistics and Data Science conference brought together hundreds of data scientists and statisticians from all walks of life in an intimate setting to share their personal and professional experiences.</description>
